# Instructions

- First, obtain an API key and Sandbox key from IEXCloud, and set them as environment variables named "API_KEY" and "SANDBOX_KEY"

- After that, specify the amount of money to start with by replacing the lines of `money.azh` with the amount of money to start with.

- Then, configure `settings.json` with your preferred stock or crypto to trade ("WATCH"), make sure it's supported by IEXCloud.

- Configure the delay between each generation. (DELAY)

- And finally, specify in "MODE" if you're trading crypto or stocks.

There are also other factors to affect the trading, which you can tinker with to find the optimal values.

Run the program with `python main.py` and watch it "trade"!
